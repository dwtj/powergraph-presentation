# Instructions for Com S 641 Class Presentation

0. Your presentation must be one hour. Discuss contents from the suggested paper 
   as well as technical manuals, if any, associated with the technique that you 
   are discussing. 

1. You MUST attribute your sources. For example, if you use a picture or a slide 
   from another presentation on that topic then that slide containing material from
   other source should contain a footnote stating where it came from. A presentation
   that does not properly attribute its sources is in violation of this class's 
   policy on academic honesty.

2. Add and remove LaTeX files as you see fit. The structure of your presentation 
   can be different from the template. 

3. DO NOT change the presentation template or theme. We would like each presentation
   theme to look identical throughout the class. 

4. Rename the directory to <lastname>-<short topic name, e.g. mapreduce>.

5. Make sure that the presentation compiles without errors using the Makefile.

6. Zip the file as <lastname><short topic name, e.g. mapreduce>.zip and upload 
   on blackboard.
